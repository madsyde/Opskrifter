## Trin
Time to start the fettuccine boscaiola recipe! Using a small paring knife, remove the sausage casings then press the sausages down using a fork on a plate.

Place the pan on your stove and turn the heat to medium before pouring in 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and then add the sausages. Make sure to keep pressing the sausages as they cook, trying to separate them into smaller pieces.

Crush the garlic, adding it to the pan then add the mushrooms and stir to combine the flavors.

Once the meat starts to brown for the fettuccine boscaiola, it’s time to add the wine.

The meat mixture will take about 10 minutes to cook. During this time, make sure to continue breaking down the sausage mince using a wooden spoon until you have smaller pieces.

While this continues to simmer, add 5L of water to a large pot and when it boild, add 1 tablespoon of rock salt. Then, add the pasta to the salted boiling water and give it a quick stir.

Follow the length of time for your pasta; mine will take about 7 minutes.

Season your meat mixture with salt and a generous helping of pepper and stir to combine. Keep cooking until the mixture thickens slightly and there is very little liquid.

Add some parsley to the meat and gently cook on a low heat until the pasta is ready.

Don’t forget to grab a mug full of pasta water for the fettuccine boscaiola sauce before tipping out the pot!

Add the al dente pasta into the same pan with the meat mixture using tongs or a hand sieve.

Next, add the mascarpone in and stir until it melts.

Add about half a mug of pasta water then stir – Or toss if you’re able to!

Take the pan off the stove and add the pecorino and remaining parsley. Toss to create a delicious creamy fettuccine boscaiola.
