## Ingredienser
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 800g in total)
60g plain flour
4 tbsp olive oil
80g salted butter
Juice of 2 lemons
50ml hot chicken stock
2 tbsp nonpareille capers, drained
4 tbsp chopped fresh flat leaf parsley
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
600g baby potatoes scrubbed
1 large red pepper, deseeded and sliced into strips 5mm thick
1 large yellow pepper, deseeded and sliced into strips 5mm thick
1 large green pepper, deseeded and sliced into strips 5mm thick
4 garlic cloves, unpeeled
2 tbsp fresh rosemary leaves
6 tbsp olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Trin
Cut each chicken breast horizontally in half to produce two thin slices. Put the flour on a large plate and season with salt and pepper. Dip the chicken in the seasoned flour to lightly coat. Shake off any excess flour.

Heat the oil and half the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the chicken and fry for 5-6 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to a warmed dish and cover with foil to keep warm.

To make the sauce, add the lemon juice, stock and capers to the pan juices. Stir and scrape the bottom of the pan to release any sticky bits left from the chicken. Bring to the boil, stirring, and boil for 1 minute. Add the parsley and remaining butter and simmer for 1 further minute, stirring until blended.

To serve, place two pieces of chicken on a warm plate and drizzle over the sauce. Serve immediately.

**Roasted new potatoes with peppers, garlic and rosemary**

This is the way my mother used to cook potatoes for me when I was growing up, and it’s how I make roast potatoes for my wife and children today. It’s a really easy recipe, as everything goes into one roasting tin and there’s no need to parboil the potatoes. If you prefer, you can use courgettes or carrots instead of peppers and fresh thyme instead of rosemary. It makes a perfect accompaniment to any fish or meat dish.

Preheat the oven to 200C, gas 6. Put the potatoes, peppers, garlic and rosemary in a medium roasting tin. Pour over the oil and season with salt and pepper.

Toss the vegetables in the oil. Use your hands to combine all the ingredients and make sure everything is well coated in the oil, including the bottom of the tin.

Roast for 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and golden brown, stirring halfway through cooking. Serve immediately.
