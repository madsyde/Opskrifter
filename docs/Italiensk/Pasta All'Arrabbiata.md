# Pasta All'Arrabbiata

## Ingredienser
- 2-4 hot chilli’s (depending on how hot you can handle it!)
- 2 x garlic cloves
- Parsley (chopped finely)
- Basil
- Rock Salt
- 400 g Busiati Trapanesi
- 800 g peeled tomatoes
- Grated pecorino cheese
- Salt and Pepper

## Trin
1. Put a large pot with 5L water on the stove so the water starts to boil in preparation for the pasta to boil.
2. Place a wide pan on medium heat and add 2-3 generous tablespoons of EVOO to it.
3. Crush 2 x cloves of garlic and add them to the pan, before mixing the most important ingredient to our pasta all’arrabbiata: finely chopped chilli to the pan too.
4. Mix this through well, dropping it to a lower temperature if it is getting too hot!
5. Put the peeled tomatoes into a large mixing bowl, and using your stainless steel masher, break down the tomatoes, so you are left with a thick, rich puree.
6. Add salt and pepper to the tomatoes and mix it through well.
7. Once the garlic and chilli have simmered for a couple of minutes, add the tomato puree for your pasta all’arrabbiata and mix it through well.
8. Leave the sauce on a medium heat for 15 minutes, mixing it every now and then.
9. The water should have boiled by now, so after you’ve added a small handful of rock sale – and while waiting for the sauce – add the Busiati Trapanesi and leave to cook until al-dente, for approximately 12 minutes.
9. A couple of minutes before the Arrabbiata sauce is ready, add the chopped parsley and break up some fresh basil and drop it in.
10. Strain the pasta and add it to the pan while it is still on the stove, lathering it completely in the sauce. Add a small amount of the boiling water to the sauce to help it spread all over the pasta.
11. Sprinkle grated pecorino cheese all over the pasta all’arrabbiata, then mix it through.
