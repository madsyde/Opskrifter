# Puttanesca

## Ingredienser
- 300g â€“ Spaghetti (use a dry, long pasta) OR Penne
- 6x Anchovies in olive oil
- 2x Tablespoons of Capers under salt
- 2 garlic cloves
- Kalamata olives (Or Gaeta olives if you can get them!)
- 1 tin peeled tomatoes (or a generous amount of juicy cherry tomatoes)
- Bunch fresh parsley
- Rock Salt
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and Pepper

## Trin
Puttanesca sauce is very flavoursome and salty so start by washing the capers under water to remove the salt.

Put the water on to boil (before you start making the puttanesca pasta) so that you cook your pasta at the same time as you make your sauce.

Next put a fry pan on your stove at a medium heat and add a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

Once the oil has started to warm up add your anchovies (approx. 2-3 per person) and melt them into the oil by moving them around with a spatula.

Leave these for around a minute as they will start to shrink and infuse the oil with the flavours.

Next add the garlic (either finely chopped or pressed) and olives, and mix this through.

When you add the olives, gently squeeze them with your hands, before adding them to the pan. Continue to mix all of the Puttanesca pasta ingredients together.

Now add a sprinkle of salt and pepper to the bowl of peeled tomatoes, along with freshly chopped parsley and mix it well before squashing it all down using a potato masher!

Mix this until you get a much smoother consistency, leaving the puttanesca sauce ingredients to lightly simmer.

Pour in the tomato mixture and let this simmer for a few minutes, stirring it every so often.

Once the pasta is ready, strain it, and add it to the pan.

Toss the pan with the puttanesca pasta so all of the ingredients dance together.

Remove the pan from the stove.

**HOW TO SERVE**

Serve up a single portion of puttanesca pasta on a flat plate and enjoy nice and hot! Make sure once you have served it up on a plate, you use a spoon to scoop up some extra capers and olives from the puttanesca sauce and add it to each portion. Sprinkle some freshly chopped parsley on top. It will be full of flavour with an added kick, so enjoy every mouthful.
