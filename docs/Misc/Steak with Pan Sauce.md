## Ingredienser
1–1½ pounds steak (sirloin, boneless ribeye, or NY strip)
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small shallot
2 garlic cloves
¼ cup (½ stick) cold unsalted butter
2 sprigs thyme
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

## Trin
Let 1–1½ pounds steak sit at room temperature for as long as possible before cooking (even if it’s only for 10 minutes, that’s fine). Pat steak dry with paper towels.

Heat a medium dry skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Season steak while you wait for the skillet to get nice and hot. Sprinkle lots of salt and pepper on both sides of steak—A LOT. Use several generous pinches of salt and several cranks of pepper per side. Press salt and pepper into meat so it adheres.

Pour 1 Tbsp. oil into skillet and swirl to coat. Using tongs, gently lay steak in skillet and cook until underside is deeply browned and a crust has formed, about 5 minutes. Once or twice, lift up steak and reposition over hotter areas of the skillet to encourage even cooking.

Let skillet cool about 5 minutes. While skillet is cooling, peel and finely chop 1 shallot. Smash 2 garlic cloves with the flat side of your knife and remove peel. Cut ¼ cup (½ stick) butter into 4 Tbsp.-size pieces. Set aside and have at the ready.

Place skillet back over medium-low heat and add shallot, garlic, 2 sprigs thyme, and 2 Tbsp. butter. Swirl skillet to melt butter and cook, stirring often with a whisk, until shallot is golden brown, 2–3 minutes.

Add ½ cup water to skillet and whisk to dissolve stuck-on bits. Whisk in 2 Tbsp. mustard and 2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce until smooth.
