## Ingredienser
**Meatballs**
- 450g Beef Mince
- 45g Breadcrumbs
- 1/2 onion, finely chopped
- 1 egg
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 2 tbsp vegetable/corn/sunflower oil

**Sauce**
- 480 ml beef stock
- 480 ml milk
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1 tbsp worcester sauce
- 180 g tagliatelle pasta
- 100 g grated parmesan
- 3 tbsp chopped parsley

## Trin
1. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, onion, egg, salt, and pepper, mixing until evenly combined. Heat the canola oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Take about a golf-ball size of the meatball mixture and roll it into balls. Place the meatballs into the pot, cooking for one minute. Flip the meatballs.
2. Add the beef broth, milk, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce and give it a stir. Bring the liquid to a boil, then add the egg noodles. Stir constantly until the pasta is cooked and the liquid has reduced to a sauce that coats the noodles, about seven to eight minutes. Add the parmesan and the parsley, stirring until the cheese is melted. Serve!
